# Documentation Intro

Welcome to **taggy**! 🐓


## Overview

Tagging content in web-based editorial systems, i.e. assigning content to a selection of topics

- is mostly still done manually
- therefore tedious and error-prone

especially when it comes to large amounts of data.

Proprietary systems are often expensive and questionable in terms of data protection
dart taggy is here to give you an

- open
- easy-to-start-with
- easy-to-integrate and
- quite powerful frontend tool

to fit your tagging needs.

## Status

Currently under heavy development 🏗️

You can watch the development status on [Github](https://github.com/open-taggy).


## How-to

Coming soon.

<!-- 
## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
